# 🌞 Solar Panel Degradation Predictor - Panel Scan

An AI-powered system designed to monitor and predict degradation in solar panels using drone-captured data, deep learning, and real-time dashboards.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Solar panels are often affected by microcracks, soiling, and other physical degradations that reduce their efficiency. Manual inspections are time-consuming and costly. This project leverages **drone-based thermal imaging**, **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, and a **visual dashboard** to automate early fault detection and support proactive maintenance planning.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

- Microcracks and dirt accumulation in solar panels reduce energy output.
- Lack of early detection leads to higher maintenance costs and efficiency loss.

## 💡 Solution

- **Drones** capture thermal images of solar panels.
- A **CNN model** built using **PyTorch** analyzes the images to detect faults.
- A **Plotly-based dashboard** displays real-time panel health status and alerts.

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **PyTorch** – CNN model for fault detection  
- **UAV Drones** – Data (image) acquisition  
- **Plotly** – Interactive dashboard for monitoring  
- **HTML/CSS/JS** – Frontend structure  
- **Python** – Backend scripting and data processing

## 📊 Features

- Automatic detection of microcracks and soiling  
- Real-time panel health visualization  
- Maintenance alert system  
- Scalable for solar farms and large installations

## ✅ Project Outcomes

- 🔺 **15% boost** in panel efficiency  
- 💰 **30% reduction** in maintenance cost  
- ⚡ Enhanced reliability in solar energy management  
- 📈 Estimated scanning of **200K+ panels per mission**
